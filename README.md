We can manage suppliers in multiple ways. The right-side buttons allow us to search for a supplier based on different parameters, making it easier to quickly locate the desired record. On the other hand, the left-side buttons provide options to add new suppliers, update existing supplier information, or delete suppliers from the system, ensuring that the supplier database remains accurate and up to date.
